# GCNN

**Update:** Please check out more GNN-based fake news detection models along with two real-world datasets in [A collection of GNN-based fake news detectors with fake news propagation datasets](https://github.com/safe-graph/GNN-FakeNews). 

The Pytorch-Geometric Implementation of GCNN model for fake news detection, the original model is proposed in the following paper:

Paper: [Fake News Detection on Social Media using Geometric Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06673.pdf)

To run the model, you need to have at least Python 3.6 and install following packages:

```bash
PyTorch 1.6.0
PyTorch Geometric 1.6.1
tqdm
sklearn
```
